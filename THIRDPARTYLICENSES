 The information on government servers are in the public domain, unless

long as you do not 1) claim it is your own (e.g. by claiming copyright for
NWS information -- see below), 2) use it in a manner that implies an
endorsement or affiliation with NOAA/NWS, or 3) modify it in content and
then present it as official government material. You also cannot present
information of your own in a way that makes it appear to be official
government information..

 The user assumes the entire risk related to its use of this data. NWS is
providing this data "as is," and NWS disclaims any and all warranties,
whether express or implied, including (without limitation) any implied
warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. In no
