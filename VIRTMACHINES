This is documentation for ASP developers about how set up a Linux
virtual machine and build ASP and its dependencies inside of it. A
virtual machine makes it easier work on a desired OS version and to
install third-party libraries.

We use KVM to manage virtual machines. The system administrators
need to have it installed on the host machine. 

It is suggested that the virtual machine (the guest) to be used for
building ASP be reasonably old, so that the shipped ASP build works on
as many machines as possible. Here is an example of installing Ubuntu 16
as a guest.

wget http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.6-desktop-amd64.iso
mkdir -p ~/projects/libvrt
fallocate -l 70000M ~/projects/libvrt/ubuntu16.img
virt-install -r 8192 --accelerate -n ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64 -f ~/projects/libvrt/ubuntu16.img --cdrom ubuntu-16.04.6-desktop-amd64.iso  --vcpus=8 --vnc --vncport=5950

# Managing the virtual machine

To open a GUI in the machine, use either:

  vncviewer localhost:5950

(the same VNC port used when the machine was created), or 

  virt-viewer ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64

Use

  virsh list --all 

to view the guests, 

  virsh start <machine> 

to start it, 

  virsh destroy <machine> 

to force shutting down the guest, and 

  virsh undefine <guest> 

followed by 

  rm -rf ~/projects/libvrt 

to wipe any trace of all guest machines (use with extreme care!).

# Connecting to the guest via ssh using remote port forwarding

A connection from the host to a guest can be done by reverse port 
forwarding (there should be a better way). 

Here is an example. From the guest, one can do:

ssh -f -N HOSTUSER@HOST -R 6000:localhost:22

Then, from HOST, one should be able to connect to the guest via:

  ssh localhost -p 6000 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l GUESTUSER

The sshd daemon may need to be installed or restarted on the guest,
and the guest must be configured to allow incoming ssh connections. If
the following lines are added to HOST's .ssh/config:

Host GUEST
  Hostname localhost
  HostKeyAlias GUEST
  CheckHostIP no
  Port 6000
  User GUESTUSER

then one should be able to connect to the guest simply by running 
ssh GUEST. 

Occasionally a port may become unavailable, and hence will need to be changed.

# Speeding up network access

The network speed between HOST and GUEST can be very slow. It can be
greatly sped up using virtio. This can be done as follows.

Locate the virtual machine, for example, with the command:

virsh list --all

Here it is assumed we name it ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64.

Dump and edit an xml file:

virsh dumpxml ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64 > ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64.xml
vim ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64.xml

Under the line

 <mac address='...'/> 

add the line:

 <model type='virtio'/>   

Save this file and exit. Then undefine, shut down, redefine, and
restart the machine as follows:

virsh undefine ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64
virsh destroy ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64
virsh create ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64.xml
virsh start ubuntu-16.04.5-amd64
 
# Further customization and administration

The number of CPUs and RAM for GUEST can be changed each time before
starting it by again editing the xml file.

See INSTALLGUIDE for how to continue the installation of dependencies
and building ASP.
