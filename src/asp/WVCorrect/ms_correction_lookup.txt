# ASP implements CCD artifacts correction only for a handful of bands
# for a few TDI and scan directions for certain Digital Globe
# satellite multispectral images. The corrections are stored as rows
# in a set of .TIF images. This lookup table shows for each TDI and
# scan direction which row of which TIF correction image has the
# corrections.

# Multiple such images are allowed, though only one exists so far.

# This lookup table is read at run-time by wv_correct and is
# distributed with ASP, together with the correction image.
