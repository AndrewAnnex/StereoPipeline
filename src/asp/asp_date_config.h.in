   File src/asp/asp_date_config.h.in. Used by CMake to generate
   asp_date_config.h. This is kept separate from asp_config.h since
   the build date and commit id changes often when the software is
   built locally, which results in massive recompilation. This way only 
   Common.cc will get recompiled.
