.. _shallow_water_bathy:

Shallow-water bathymetry
------------------------

ASP supports creation of terrain models where parts of the terrain are
under water. Assuming that the water is shallow, still, clear, with
sufficient texture to match at the water bottom between the left and
right images, the rays emanating from the cameras and converging at
those features will be bent according to Snell's law at the water
interface, hence determining correctly the position of underwater
terrain.

The bathymetry module is evaluated in :cite:`palaseanu2021bathy` and
:cite:`palaseanu2023`.


Software considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ASP supports the bathymetry mode only with the ``dg``, ``rpc``, and
``nadirpinhole`` sessions, so with Digital Globe linescan cameras, RPC
cameras, and pinhole cameras (:numref:`bathy_non_dg`), all for
Earth. Both raw and mapprojected images can be used
(:numref:`bathy_map`), with or without bundle adjustment or alignment
(:numref:`bathy_and_align`).

Physics considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shallow water does not appear equally transparent at all wavelengths,
which will affect the quality of the results. While the process we
outline below will work, in principle, with any data, we will focus on
stereo with the G band (green, stored at band 3) of Digital Globe
multispectral imagery, and we will use the N band (near-infrared 1,
stored at band 7), to determine a mask of the ground vs water.

These or any other bands can be extracted from a multi-band image as follows:

::
     
     b=3
     gdal_translate -b ${b} -co compress=lzw -co TILED=yes \
       -co BLOCKXSIZE=256 -co BLOCKYSIZE=256               \
       input.TIF input_b${b}.tif

The extra options, in addition to ``-b ${b}`` to extract a given band,
are needed to create a compressed and tiled output image, which helps
with the performance of ASP later.

.. _bathy_threshold_use:

Computation of the water-land threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to distinguish points on land from those under water, a
mask needs to be computed for each of the left and right input images,
with the masks having the same dimensions as those images.

A simple way of creating such a mask is to first determine a threshold
such that pixels at or below threshold are under water, and those
above threshold are on land.

It was experimentally found that it is best to use band 7 (near
infrared) for Digital Globe multispectral images to find this water
threshold, as in them the water appears universally darker than the
land.

ASP provides two tools for finding the threshold in automated way
based on histogram analysis. One is ``bathy_threshold_calc.py``
(:numref:`bathy_threshold_calc`), and the second one is
``otsu_threshold`` (:numref:`otsu_threshold`). This last tool produces
a somewhat higher threshold compared to the other one, but in practice
the results with both approaches are very similar.

The ``bathy_threshold_calc.py`` program works based on the observation
that, since in such an image the water appears darker than the land,
then in a histogram of the pixels in the image, the water and land
appear as two noticeable peaks, with a good value for the threshold
then being the image value at the bottom of the valley between those
peaks.

For robustness to noise, this histogram is approximated by a
kernel-density estimate (``KDE``) using Gaussian kernels. It is very
important to note that even then this tool may return the wrong
minimum, which it assumes to be the first one.

Therefore, this tool plots the histogram, its kernel density estimate,
the positions of the minima, and prints their locations on screen. The
user is responsible for validating visually where the most appropriate
position of the minimum is (along the horizontal axis).
 
The kernel-density estimate calculation is very time-consuming for
large images, hence it is suggested to pass to the tool the number of
samples to use (it will pick the samples uniformly in the image). For
example, if a million samples are used, the calculation should take
a few minutes to complete.

This program can be invoked for each of the left and right images as follows:

::

    ~/miniconda3/envs/bathy/bin/python $(which bathy_threshold_calc.py) \
      --image left.tif --num-samples 1000000

Here it is assumed that ASP's ``bin`` directory is in the path. The ``bathy``
conda environment should be installed as described in
:numref:`bathy_threshold_calc`.

It is suggested to experiment a bit with the number of samples, using,
for example, double of this amount, and see the difference. Normally
the outcome should be rather similar.

It will produce the following output:

::

    Image file is left.tif
    Number of samples is 1000000
    Number of image rows and columns: 7276, 8820
    Picking a uniform sample of dimensions 908, 1101
    Please be patient. It make take several minutes to find the answer.
    Positions of the minima:  [ 155.18918919  802.7027027 ... ]
    Suggested threshold is the position of the first minimum:  155.1891891891892
    Please verify with the graph. There is a chance the second minimum may work better.
    Elapsed time in seconds: 275.2

   Example of the graph plotted by bathy_threshold_calc.py

Once the threshold is found, ``stereo_gui`` can be used to visualize
the regions at or below threshold (:numref:`thresh`).

.. _bathy_mask_creation:

Creation of masks based on the threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having determined the water-land threshold, the left and right image
masks will be found from the corresponding images as follows:

::
    
    left_thresh=155.1891891891892 
    image_calc -c "max($left_thresh, var_0)" -d float32 \
      --output-nodata-value $left_thresh                \
      left_b7.tif -o left_mask.tif

Here, ``left_b7.tif`` is suggestive of the fact that the band 7 of
WorldView multispectral imagery was used.

It is important to remember to use the right image threshold when repeating
this process for the right image. 

This tool sets the pixel values at or below threshold to the no-data
value, while keeping unchanged the values above the threshold.

Later, when doing stereo, if, based on the masks, a pixel in the left
image is under water, while the corresponding pixel in the right image
is not, for noise or other reasons, that pixel pair will be declared
to be on land and hence no bathymetry correction will take place for
this pair. Hence, some inspection and potentially cleanup of the
masks may be necessary.

.. _water_surface:

Determination of the water surface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to run stereo and properly triangulate the rays which 
may intersect under water, it is necessary to determine
the water surface. Since for images of large extent the Earth
curvature will be important, this surface will be found as a plane
in a local stereographic projection.

The procedure for this is described in :numref:`bathy_plane_calc`.

Stereo with bathymetry correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having these in place, stereo can then happen as follows:

::

    parallel_stereo -t dg left.tif right.tif left.xml right.xml \
      --left-bathy-mask left_mask.tif                           \
      --right-bathy-mask right_mask.tif                         \
      --stereo-algorithm asp_mgm                                \
      --refraction-index 1.34 --bathy-plane bathy_plane.txt     \
      run_bathy/run 
 
Here we specified the two masks, the water index of refraction, and
the water plane found before.

See :numref:`nextsteps` for a discussion about various
speed-vs-quality choices.

This is followed by creating a DEM::

    point2dem run_bathy/run-PC.tif --orthoimage run_bathy/run-L.tif 

The water refraction index was set 1.34 :cite:`jerlov1976marine`. 
Alternatively, one could use 1.333 
:cite:`thormahlen1985refractive,harvey1998calibration`, or a more
precise value that depends on wavelength, temperature, and if having
saltwater or freshwater (`Parrish (2020)
<http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/parrish/index-refraction-seawater-and-freshwater-function-wavelength-and-temperature>`_,
:cite:`austin1976index,mobley1995optical`).  For example, using the
equation and coefficients found in Parrish (2020), and the green
wavelength for saltwater, the water refraction index is 1.340125 when
the water temperature is 27 |deg| C (this was applied to a Florida
Keys test site for the month of May).

The obtained point cloud will have both triangulated points above water,
so with no correction, and below water, with the correction applied.
If desired to have only one of the two, call the ``parallel_stereo`` command
with the option ``--output-cloud-type`` with the value ``topo``
or ``bathy`` respectively (the default for this option is ``all``).

The bathymetry correction happens at the triangulation stage
(though the necessary transformations on the bathymetry masks are done
in pre-processing). Hence, after a stereo run finished, it is only
necessary to re-run the ``stereo_tri`` step if desired to apply this
correction or not, or if to change the value of
``--output-cloud-type``.

As in usual invocations of stereo, the input images may be
mapprojected, and then a DEM is expected, stereo may happen only in
certain regions as chosen in the GUI, bundle adjustment may be used,
the output point cloud may be converted to LAS, etc. 

.. _bathy_validation:

Performing sanity checks on a bathy run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The results produced with the bathymetry mode for stereo need careful
validation. Here we will show how to examine if the water-land
boundary and corresponding water surface were found correctly.

Before that, it is important to note that such runs can take a long
time, and one should try to first perform a bathymetry experiment
in a carefully chosen small area by running ``stereo_gui`` instead of
``parallel_stereo``, while keeping the rest of the bathy options as
above, and then selecting clips in the left and right images with the
mouse to run ``parallel_stereo`` on. See :numref:`stereo_gui` for more
info.

If the ``bathy_plane_calc`` is run with the option::

    --output-inlier-shapefile inliers.shp

it will produce a shapefile for the inliers.

Create an orthoimage from the aligned bathy mask, for example,
such as::

    point2dem --no-dem run_bathy/run-PC.tif                \
      --orthoimage run_bathy/run-L_aligned_bathy_mask.tif  \
      -o run_bathy/run-bathy_mask

This should create ``run_bathy/run-bathy_mask-DRG.tif``.

This should be overlayed in ``stereo_gui`` on top of the inliers
from the bathy plane calculation, as::

    stereo_gui --single-window --use-georef inliers.shp    \
      run_bathy/run-bathy_mask-DRG.tif

The inliers should be well-distributed on the land-water interface
as shown by the mask.

To verify that the water surface was found correctly, one can
create a DEM with no bathymetry correction, subtract from that one the
DEM with bathymetry correction, and colorize the result. This can be
done by redoing the triangulation in the previous run, this time with
no bathy information::

    mv run_bathy/run-DEM.tif run_bathy/run-yesbathy-DEM.tif
    parallel_stereo -t dg left.tif right.tif left.xml right.xml \
      --stereo-algorithm asp_mgm                                \
      --entry-point 5 run_bathy/run 
    point2dem run_bathy/run-PC.tif -o run_bathy/run-nobathy
    
Note that we started by renaming the bathy DEM. The result of these
commands will be ``run_bathy/run-nobathy-DEM.tif``. The differencing
and colorizing is done as::

    geodiff run_bathy/run-nobathy-DEM.tif             \
      run_bathy/run-yesbathy-DEM.tif -o run_bathy/run
    colormap --min 0 --max 1 run_bathy/run-diff.tif

The obtained file, ``run_bathy/run-diff_CMAP.tif``, can be added to
the ``stereo_gui`` command from above. Colors hotter than blue will be
suggestive of how much the depth elevation changed as result of
bathymetry correction. It is hoped that no changes will be seen on
land, and that the inliers bound well the region where change of depth
happened.

.. _bathy_and_align:

Bundle adjustment and alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to note that we did not use bundle adjustment
(:numref:`bundle_adjust`) or ``pc_align`` (:numref:`pc_align`) for
alignment. That is possible, but then one has to ensure that all the
data are kept consistent under such operations.

In particular, running bundle adjustment on a PAN image pair, and then
on a corresponding multispectral band pair, will result in DEMs which
are no longer aligned either to each other, or to their versions
before bundle adjustment. The cameras can be prevented by moving too
far if ``bundle_adjust`` is called with, for example, ``--tri-weight
0.1``, or some other comparable value, to constrain the triangulated
points. Yet, by its very nature, this program changes the positions
and orientations of the cameras, and therefore the coordinate
system. And note that a very high camera weight may interfere with the
convergence of bundle adjustment.

It is suggested to use these tools only if a trusted reference dataset
exists, and then the produced DEMs should be aligned to that dataset.

Only the "topo" component of a DEM obtained with ASP should be used
for alignment (see ``--output-cloud-type``), that is, the part above
water, as the part under water can be quite variable given the water
level. Here's an example for creating the "topo" DEM, just the
triangulation stage processing needs modification::

    parallel_stereo -t dg left.tif right.tif left.xml right.xml \
      --stereo-algorithm asp_mgm                                \
      <other options>                                           \
      --entry-point 5 --output-cloud-type topo                  \
        run_bathy/run
   point2dem run_bathy/run-PC.tif -o run_bathy/run-topo

which will create ``run_bathy/run-topo-DEM.tif``.

Then, after the "topo" DEM is aligned, the alignment transform can be
applied to the full DEM (obtained at triangulation stage with
``--output-cloud-type all``), as detailed in :numref:`prevtrans`. The
input cameras can be aligned using the same transform
(:numref:`ba_pc_align`).

When the water surface is determined using a DEM, a mask of the image
portion above water, and corresponding camera, and the cameras have
been bundle-adjusted or aligned, the option ``--bundle-adjust-prefix``
must be used with ``bathy_plane_calc`` (see
:numref:`bathy_plane_calc_example1`).

Validation of alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is very strongly suggested to use visual inspection in
``stereo_gui`` and the ``geodiff`` and ``colormap`` tools for
differencing DEMs to ensure DEMs that are meant to be aligned have
small differences. Since bathymetry modeling can measure only very
shallow water depths, any misalignment can result in big errors in
final results.

If DEMs have parts under water and it is desired to remove those for
the purpose of alignment, one can take advantage of the fact that the
water height is roughly horizontal. Hence, a command like::

    height=-21.2
    image_calc -c "max($height, var_0)" -d float32 \
      --output-nodata-value $height                \
      dem.tif -o topo_dem.tif

will eliminate all heights under -21.2 meters (relative to the
datum ellipsoid).

Bathymetry with changing water level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the left and right images were acquired at different times,
the water level may be different among the two, for example because
of the tide. Then, ``bathy_plane_calc`` (:numref:`bathy_plane_calc`) 
can be used independently for the left and right images, obtaining
two such surfaces. These can be passed to ASP as follows::

    parallel_stereo --bathy-plane "left_plane.txt right_plane.txt" \
      --stereo-algorithm asp_mgm                                   \
      <other options>
 
The computation will go as before until the triangulation stage.
There, the rays emanating from the cameras will bend when meeting the
water at different elevations given by these planes, and their
intersection may happen in three possible regimes (above both planes,
in between them, or below both of them).

Care must be taken when doing stereo with images acquired at a different
times as the illumination may be too different. A good convergence
angle is also expected (:numref:`stereo_pairs`).

.. _bathy_reuse_run:

How to reuse most of a run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stereo can take a long time, and the results can have a large size on
disk. It is possible to reuse most of such a run, using the option
``--prev-run-prefix``, if cameras or camera adjustments (option
``--bundle-adjust-prefix``) get added, removed, or change, if the
water surface (``--bathy-plane``) or index of refraction change, or if
the previous run did not do bathy modeling but the new run does (hence
the options ``--left-bathy-mask`` and ``--right-bathy-mask`` got
added).

One must not change ``--left-image-crop-win`` and
``--right-image-crop-win`` in the meantime, if used, as that may
invalidate the intermediate files we want to reuse, nor the input
images. If the previous run did employ bathy masks, and it is desired
to change them (rather than add them while they were not there
before), run the ``touch`` command on the new bathy masks, to give
the software a hint that the alignment of such masks should be redone.

As an example, consider a run with no bathymetry modeling::

    parallel_stereo -t dg left.tif right.tif left.xml right.xml \
      --stereo-algorithm asp_mgm                                \
      run_nobathy/run 
 
A second run, with output prefix ``run_bathy/run``, can be started
directly at the triangulation stage while reusing the earlier stages
from the other run as::

    parallel_stereo -t dg left.tif right.tif left.xml right.xml         \
      --stereo-algorithm asp_mgm                                        \
      --left-bathy-mask left_mask.tif --right-bathy-mask right_mask.tif \
      --refraction-index 1.34 --bathy-plane bathy_plane.txt             \
      --bundle-adjust-prefix ba/run run_yesbathy/run                    \
      --prev-run-prefix run_nobathy/run

The explanation behind the shortcut employed above is that the precise
cameras and the bathy info are fully used only at the triangulation
stage. That because the preprocessing step (step 0), mostly does
alignment, for which some general knowledge of the cameras and bathy
information is sufficient, and other steps, before triangulation, work
primarily on images. This option works by making symbolic links 
to files created at previous stages of stereo which are needed at 
triangulation.

Note that if the cameras changed, the user must recompute the bathy
planes first, using the updated cameras. The ``bathy_plane_calc`` tool
which is used for that can take into account the updated cameras via
the ``--bundle-adjust-prefix`` option passed to it.

If the software notices that the current run invoked with
``--prev-run-prefix`` employs bathy masks, unlike that previous run,
or that the modification time of the bathy masks passed in is newer
than of files in that run, it will ingest and align the new masks
before performing triangulation.

.. _bathy_map:

Bathymetry correction with mapprojected images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapprojecting the input images can improve the results on steep slopes
(:numref:`mapproj-example`). While that may not be a big concern in
bathymetry applications, this section nevertheless illustrates how
stereo with shallow water can be done with mapprojection.

Given an external DEM, the left and right images can be mapprojected
onto this DEM, for example as:

::

  mapproject external_dem.tif --tr gridSize \
    left.tif left.xml left_map.tif

and the same for the right image. The same ground sample distance
(resolution) must be used for left and right images, which should be
appropriately chosen depending on the data (:numref:`mapproj-res`).


One should mapproject the same way the left and right band 7 Digital
Globe multispectral images (if applicable), obtaining two images,
``left_map_b7.tif`` and ``right_map_b7.tif``. These two can be used to
find the masks, as earlier:

::

    left_thresh=155.1891891891892 
    image_calc -c "max($left_thresh, var_0)" \
      --output-nodata-value $left_thresh     \
      left_map_b7.tif -o left_map_mask.tif

(and the same for the right image.)

The threshold determined with the original non-mapprojected images
should still work, and the same water plane can be used.

Then, stereo happens as above, with the only differences being the
addition of the external DEM and the new names for the images and the
masks:

:: 

    parallel_stereo -t dg left_map.tif right_map.tif   \
      left.xml right.xml                               \
      --stereo-algorithm asp_mgm                       \
      --left-bathy-mask left_map_mask.tif              \
      --right-bathy-mask right_map_mask.tif            \
      --refraction-index 1.34                          \
      --bathy-plane bathy_plane.txt                    \
      run_map/run external_dem.tif                       


Using Digital Globe PAN images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bathymetry mode can be used with Digital Globe PAN images as well,
though likely the water bottom may not be as transparent in this case
as for the Green band.

Yet, if desired to do so, a modification is necessary if the mask
for pixels above water is obtained not from the PAN image itself,
but from a band of the corresponding multispectral image,
because those are acquired with different sensors. 

Starting with a multispectral image mask, one has to first increase
its resolution by a factor of 4 to make it comparable to the PAN
image, then crop about 50 columns on the left, and further crop or
extend the scaled mask to match the PAN image dimensions.

ASP provides a tool for doing this, which can be called as::

    scale_bathy_mask.py ms_mask.tif pan_image.tif output_pan_mask.tif

Any warnings about ``srcwin ... falls partially outside raster
extent`` should be ignored. GDAL will correctly pad the scaled mask
with no-data values if it has to grow it to match the PAN image.

To verify that the PAN image and obtained scaled PAN mask agree,
overlay them in ``stereo_gui``, by choosing from the top menu the
option ``View->Single window``.

It is not clear if the number of columns to remove on the left should
be 50 or 48 pixels. It appears that 50 pixels works better for WV03
while 48 pixels may be appropriate for WV02. These were observed
to result in a smaller shift among these images. The default is 50.
If desired to experiment with another amount, pass that one
as an additional argument to the tool, after the output PAN mask.

.. _bathy_non_dg:

Using non-Digital Globe images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stereo with bathymetry was tested with RPC cameras. In fact, the
above examples can be re-run by just replacing ``dg`` with ``rpc`` for
the ``-t`` option. (It is suggested that the shoreline shapefile and
the water plane be redone for the RPC case. It is expected that the
results will change to a certain extent.)

Experiments were also done with pinhole cameras (using the
``nadirpinhole`` session) with both raw and mapprojected images, and
using the alignment methods 'epipolar', 'affineepipolar',
'homography', and 'none', giving plausible results.

Effect of bathymetry correction on the output DEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is instructive to compare the DEMs with and without the bathymetry
correction.

The bathymetry correction results in the points in the output
triangulated cloud being pushed "down", as the rays emanating from the
cameras become "steeper" after meeting the water.

Yet, a DEM is obtained by binning and doing weighted averaging of the
points in the cloud. It can happen that with the bathymetry
correction on, a point may end up in a different bin than with it off,
with the result being that a handful of heights in the
bathymetry-corrected DEM can be slightly above the same heights in the
DEM without the correction, which is counter-intuitive.

This however will happen only close to the water-land interface and is
an expected gridding artifact. (A different DEM grid size may result
in the artifacts changing location and magnitude.)
