K10
---

K10 is an Earth-based research rover within the Intelligent Robotics
Group at NASA Ames, the group ASP developers belong to. The cameras on
this rover use a simple Pinhole model. The use of ASP with these cameras
is illustrated in the ``examples/K10`` directory (just type 'make'
there). Just as for the MER datatset (:numref:`mer-example`),
only the creation of a point cloud is supported.

See :numref:`examples` for other examples.
