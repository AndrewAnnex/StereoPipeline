Stereo processing examples
==========================

This chapter showcases a variety of results that are possible when
processing different data sets with the Stereo Pipeline. It is also a
shortened guide that shows the commands used to process specific mission
data. There is no definitive method yet for making elevation models as
each stereo pair is unique. We hope that the following sections serve as
a cookbook for strategies that will get you started in processing your
own data. We recommend that you second check your results against
another source.

Structure-from-Motion examples are in :numref:`sfm_examples`.
