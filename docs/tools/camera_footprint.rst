camera_footprint
----------------

The tool ``camera_footprint`` computes what the footprint of in image
would be if map projected on to a provided datum or DEM and prints it to
the screen. If a KML output path is provided it will also create a KML
file containing the footprint. The KML will show a box with an X pattern
showing the points ASP used to compute the footprint. This tool can be
useful for debugging camera orientations or getting a quick overview of
where images are located.

Usage::
