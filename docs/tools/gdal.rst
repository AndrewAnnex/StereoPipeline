GDAL tools
----------

ASP distributes in the ``bin`` directory the following GDAL tools:

- gdal_rasterize
- gdal_translate
- gdalbuildvrt
- gdaldem
- gdalinfo
- gdaltransform
- gdalwarp

These executables are compiled with JPEG2000 and BigTIFF support, and
can handle NTF images in addition to most image formats. They can be
used to see image statistics, crop and scale images, build virtual
mosaics, reproject DEMs, etc. Detailed documentation is available on the
GDAL web site, at http://www.gdal.org/.
