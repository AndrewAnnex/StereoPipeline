.. _lvis2kml:

lvis2kml
--------

A simple tool for use with LVIS (Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor) lidar
data from the NASA IceBridge program. Generates a Google Earth
compatible .kml files from either an LVIS data file (.TXT extension) or
an LVIS boundary file (.xml extension). Using this tool makes it easy to
visualize what region a given LVIS file covers and what the shape of its
data looks like. If the output path is not passed to the tool it will
generate an output path by appending ".kml" to the input path. This tool
requires the simplekml Python package to run. One way to get this is to
install the ASP Python tools, described at the end of :numref:`sparse-disp`.

Usage:: 

     > lvis2kml [options] <input path> [output path]

Command-line options for lvis2kml:

-h, --help
    Display this help message.

--name <string>
    Assign a name to the KML file.

--color <red|green|blue>
    Draw plots in the named color.

--skip <int (default: 1)>
    When loading a data file, plot only every N-th point. Has no
    effect on boundary files.

   Example of KML visualizations produced with ``lvis2kml``. The output
   from both the boundary file (red) and the data file (green) with a
   point skip of 500 are shown in this image. The color saturation of
   data points is scaled with the elevation such that the points in the
   file with the least elevation show up as white and the highest points
   show up as the specified color.
